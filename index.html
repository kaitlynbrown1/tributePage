        The "Darnley Portrait" of Elizabeth I of England. It was named after a previous owner. Probably painted from life, this portrait is the source of the face pattern called "The Mask of Youth" which would be used for authorized portraits of Elizabeth for decades to come. Recent research has shown the colours have faded. The oranges and browns would have been crimson red in Elizabeth's time.

    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Queen Elizabeth I's reign:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1558</strong> - Elizabeth I is crowned Queen. She replaced her Catholic half-sister Mary, who died childless.</li>
    <li><strong>1558</strong> - The religious settlement. The Act of Supremacy – stated Elizabeth as the Head of the Church. The Act of Uniformity - set out expectations and appearances for the church. Royal Injunctions – a set of instructions reinforcing the Acts.</li>
    <li><strong>1566</strong> - The Dutch Revolt. The Netherlands had been part of the Spanish empire since the 1550s. However, the Dutch had always governed themselves. Philip II’s decision to reorganise the Dutch government and church angered both the Dutch Catholics and the Protestants. They began to revolt against the Spanish.</li>
    <li><strong>1568</strong>  - Mary, Queen of Scots, flees from Scotland to England. Mary was forced to flee following her unsuccessful attempt to win back her Scottish throne. She raised an army following her escape from prison but was defeated at Langside (Glasgow). The imprisonment owed to her likely involvement in the murder of her second husband, Lord Darnley.</li>
    <li><strong>1569</strong> - Revolt of the Northern Earls. Two influential Catholic families – the Percys and the Nevilles – plotted alongside the Duke of Norfolk to overthrow Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic, Mary, Queen of Scots (who now resided in England). Norfolk was also expected to marry Mary. Elizabeth sent an army of 14,000 men to crush the revolt, which lasted around a month (November to December).</li>
    <li><strong>1571</strong> - The Ridolfi Plot. Roberto Ridolfi was a spy of the Pope. He plotted a Spanish invasion of England, which would involve the killing of Elizabeth and the placing of Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne. As with the 1569 plot, she would marry the Duke of Norfolk. The plot was uncovered whilst Ridolfi was abroad (he never returned). Norfolk was killed in 1572. Mary was spared.</li>
    <li><strong>1574</strong> - Catholic priests are first smuggled into England. With the Pope’s blessing, foreign Catholic priests were smuggled into England with the sole purpose of continuing recusancy amongst the English Catholics and undermining the influence of Protestantism.</li>
    <li><strong>1576</strong>  - Poor Relief Act. This focused on dividing the poor into the able-bodied and the impotent. JPs provided the able-bodied with raw materials (like wool) to make items to sell. Those who refused this were sent to prison.</li>
    <li><strong>1577-80</strong>  - Francis Drake circumnavigates the world. Drake was the first English person to achieve this (and the second person in history at the time). It was estimated that Drake returned with approximately £400,000 of Spanish treasure from regular raids of Spanish ports in South America.</li>
    <li><strong>1580</strong> - Francis Drake is knighted on the Golden Hind. This was an important symbolic gesture, which angered Philip II. He saw Drake as a pirate and therefore deemed Elizabeth’s act as deliberately provocative.</li>
    <li><strong>1583</strong> - The Throckmorton Plot. Mary, Queen of Scot’s cousin (the French Duke of Guise) intended to invade England, free Mary, overthrow Elizabeth and restore Catholicism. English Catholic Francis Throckmorton was the link of communication within this plan. Spymaster and Secretary of State from 1573 Francis Walsingham uncovered the plot. Throckmorton was tortured and although he confessed, was then killed. Thereafter, up to 11,000 English Catholics were either arrested or placed under surveillance.</li>
    <li><strong>1584</strong> - Treaty of Joinville. The French Catholic League signed this treaty with Philip II of Spain. The aim was to rid France of heresy (Protestantism). This meant two of the most powerful European nations were now united against Protestantism, placing Elizabeth in a precarious position.</li>
    <li><strong>1585</strong> - Treaty of Nonsuch. This significantly committed Elizabeth to support the Dutch rebels directly against the Spanish. She pledged to finance an army of 7,400 English troops and placed Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in charge of them. Essentially, this meant England and Spain were now at war.</li>
    <li><strong>1586</strong> - The Babington Plot. Philip II and the Pope supported the plot that would involve the invasion of England by the Duke of Guise. The invasion would include the murder of Elizabeth and the placing of Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne. Anthony Babington, an English Catholic, wrote to Mary about the plot. The plot was uncovered by Sir Francis Walsingham, who intercepted and read Babington’s letters to Mary.</li>
    <li><strong>1587</strong> - Mary, Queen of Scots, is executed. Mary’s clear awareness and support of the Babington plot led to her being sentenced to death in October 1586. Elizabeth, however, did not sign the death warrant until February 1587.</li>
    <li><strong>1587</strong> - The ‘singeing of the King’s beard’. Francis Drake led an attack at Cadiz on the Spanish fleet, who were preparing for an invasion of the English. The attack was a success. 30 ships were destroyed, as well as lots of supplies. This delayed the Spanish attack and gave the English more time to prepare.</li>
    <li><strong>1588</strong> - Philip II of Spain launches the Armada. The plan was that 130 ships (equipped with 2431 guns) would sail along the Channel to the Netherlands, where they would pick up 27,000 troops, led by the Duke of Parma. The invasion failed, however.</li>
    <li><strong>1588</strong> - Failure of the Armada. July 31st: Battle of Plymouth – two Spanish ships were captured. August 3rd - 4th: Spanish ships were outgunned and forced to move to Calais in France. August 8th: Battle of Gravelines – fireships caused the Spanish fleet to scatter. They never met with the Duke of Parma and were forced to sail around the British Isles. Most of the fleet was then destroyed by storms.</li>                    
    <li><strong>1603</strong> - Elizabeth I dies after a 45 year reign over England.</li>
